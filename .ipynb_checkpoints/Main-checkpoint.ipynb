    "Equity markets consist of some of the most studied data in the world. With millions invested into research, and computational tools beyond what's accessible to the average individual, it's not hard to see that an individual investor doing their own analysis will have a tough time outperforming. Currently, I see two paths to success:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find a strategy the institutions haven't:** while possible, this is unlikely to happen considering the disparity in resources spent on the problem. You'd have to be incredibly lucky, and even still it's probably only a matter of time before an institution catches on, at which point any alpha is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find a strategy that institutions can't implement:** while the large amount of resources gives institutions ample opportunity, they also impose limitations. In particular, investing large amounts of capital has an impact on the market by moving equity prices and as a result signalling the rest of the market. This effect is especially pronounced in smaller caps. Moving large blocks of stock can be difficult and imprecise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second point presents an opportunity, and is the basis for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a stock with a 500m market cap, that has been choppy for the past two years, moving cyclically between \\\\$4.50 and \\\\$5.50. An institution sets a buy price at \\\\$5.00 and sell at \\\\$5.10, hoping to lock in a 2\\% gain every trade. Putting in an order to buy 100k shares at \\\\$5.00 will likely settle in blocks. Depending on the liquidity of the stock, executing such a large order will push up the stock price. In all likelihood, some blocks will settle at \\\\$5.00, some at \\\\$5.01... etc. Selling those 100k shares will have the opposite effect, pushing down the price during execution of the order. The result is far from the 2\\% expected return (and even has the potential to be negative depending on how much the order moves the stock price). Buying 100 shares; however, will likely settle in a single block, and thus face no such issues. \n",
