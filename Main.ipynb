    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Equity markets consist of some of the most studied data in the world. With millions invested into research, and computational tools beyond what's accessible to the average individual, it's not hard to see that an individual investor doing their own analysis will have a tough time outperforming. Currently, I see two paths to success:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find a strategy the institutions haven't:** while possible, this is unlikely to happen considering the disparity in resources spent on the problem. You'd have to be incredibly lucky, and even still it's probably only a matter of time before an institution catches on, at which point any alpha is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find a strategy that institutions can't implement:** while the large amount of resources gives institutions ample opportunity, they also impose limitations. In particular, investing large amounts of capital has an impact on the market by moving equity prices and as a result signalling the rest of the market. This effect is especially pronounced in smaller caps. Moving large blocks of stock can be difficult and imprecise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second point presents an opportunity, and is the basis for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a stock with a 500m market cap, that has been choppy for the past two years, moving cyclically between \\\\$4.50 and \\\\$5.50. A large institution sets a buy price at \\\\$5.00 and sell at \\\\$5.10, hoping to lock in a 2\\% gain every trade. Putting in an order to buy 100k shares at \\\\$5.00 will likely settle in blocks. Depending on the liquidity of the stock, executing such a large order will push up the stock price. In all likelihood, some blocks will settle at \\\\$5.00, some at \\\\$5.01... etc. Selling those 100k shares will have the opposite effect, pushing down the price during execution of the order. The result is far from the 2\\% expected return (possibly even negative, depending on how much the order moves the stock price). Buying 100 shares; however, will likely settle in a single block, and thus face no such issues. "

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will follow the following framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve stock price data from the web using the yfinance package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Design functions to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Filter stocks whose price has stayed within a given range for a given amount of time. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Backtest to find optimal buy and sell price of the given stock for iterative buys/sells within the given window.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) Calculate future returns given the optimal buy and sell price above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Segment out training data, and fit it to various different machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Regression models\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Classification models\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate the performance of the best model.\n"

    "I want to address the issue of relying on backtesting to predict future stock returns. The goal of this project is to find stocks that have been trading within a fixed range for an extended period of time, with the assumption that that will continue. Of course, not all stocks will continue to trade in the same pattern. However, by optimizing filters and implementing a tight stop, my hypothesis is that the success stories can outweigh those that don't. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other predictive model, overfitting to the training data by tuning the model parameters too specifically to the backtest can easily result in poorer actual returns. In this project, I have aimed to strike a balance between fine-tuning the model and avoiding overfitting, but it remains a concern that needs to be acknowledged."

    "Average returns per stock is **6.10% over a 90-day period**. This equates to a **24.4% annual return**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds too good to be true, and probably is. I identify the following limitations:\n",
    "1. Remember the model is biased in that it was only given current tickers. This means there was definite survivor bias within the data. As mentioned before, while I don't expect this to have an extremely significant effect (if I were gathering data all the way back to the 80s, for example, the survivor bias would be much more significant), it could play a part. \n",
    "2. Small cap stocks were filtered using the present day market cap. This is unrealistic, as a small cap in 2022 may have been a lot bigger in 2019 when the data was collected. Inversely, a stock that was actually small in 2019 and has since grown does not have it's data included here. My expectation is that this may actually bias the model to the downside (I'm essentially missing out on stocks who have grown and been successful), but this assumption is not validated. \n",
    "3. The final significant limitation of the model is sample size. While a 2000+ sample test set is not insignificant, only 25 predicted positives leaves questions about my confidence in the model's precision. This model will need to be validated further as time passes and more price data becomes available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to the positives! \n",
    "1. This model was able to select some high upside stocks while avoiding any significant downside. Really, that's every model's dream. The limitations above in mind, this model's success on the given data is undoubtedly excellent. \n",
    "2. The model appears to generalize well, with training, validation, and testing sets all having roughly the same precision scores. \n",
    "3. This model was trained over a variety of market environments. This 5-year time period is fairly unique in that there's been a condenced mix of bull and bear market events. This model was tested against data from 2020 and 2022, and managed to avoid any significant downside."
